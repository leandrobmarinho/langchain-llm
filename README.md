# LangChain-LLM  

This repository contains experiments, projects, and tutorials focused on **LangChain** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The goal is to explore and implement advanced techniques such as:  

- **ReAct Agents**  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** 
- **Embeddings & Vector Databases** 
- **LLM-powered Assistants** 
- **Prompt Engineering & Chain Optimization** 

This repository serves as a **learning hub** to test LangChain capabilities and build real-world AI-powered applications.
